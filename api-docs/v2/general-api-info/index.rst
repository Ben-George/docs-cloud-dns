General API information
-------------------------

The |apiservice| is implemented using a RESTful web service interface. Like other Rackspace 
Cloud products, the |product name| service shares a common token-based authentication 
system that allows seamless access between products and services.

.. note:: 
   
   All requests to authenticate and operate the service are performed using SSL over HTTP 
   (HTTPS) on TCP port 443.
