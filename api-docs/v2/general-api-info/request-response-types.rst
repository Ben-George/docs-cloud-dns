Request and response types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |apiservice| supports the JSON data serialization formats. The request format is 
specified using the ``Content-Type`` header and is required for calls that have a request 
body. The response format is specified in requests by using the ``Accept`` header. If no 
response format is specified, JSON is the default.
